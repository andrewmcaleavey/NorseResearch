\title{Rename SCORE Variables Using a Mapping Table}
\usage{
rename_score_vars(df, prefix = "score_", mapping = scoreNames.nf3)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the SCORE variables to be renamed.}

\item{prefix}{A character string to prepend to the cleaned scale name. Defaults to \code{"score_"}.}

\item{mapping}{A data frame with two columns: \code{ScoreName} (the original variable names)
and \code{ScaleName} (the desired human-readable names). Defaults to \code{scoreNames.nf3}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with SCORE variables renamed to the new names.
}
\description{
This function renames SCORE variables in a data frame by replacing their names with
human-readable scale names provided in a mapping table. The mapping table must contain
two columns: \code{ScoreName} (the original variable names, e.g., "SCORE_G10") and
\code{ScaleName} (the corresponding human-readable names, e.g., "Physical Anxiety").
An optional prefix (default \code{"score_"}) is prepended to the cleaned scale name.
Cleaning involves replacing spaces with underscores and removing non-alphanumeric characters,
ensuring that the new variable names are syntactically valid.
}
\details{
For each SCORE variable found in \code{df} that matches a \code{ScoreName} in \code{mapping},
the function builds a new variable name by concatenating \code{prefix} with a cleaned version
of the corresponding \code{ScaleName}. Cleaning is done by replacing spaces with underscores and
removing any characters other than letters, digits, and underscores. If duplicate names result,
\code{make.unique} is used to ensure uniqueness.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume scoreNames.nf3 is available and looks like this:
scoreNames.nf3 <- data.frame(
  ScoreName = c("SCORE_G10", "SCORE_G11", "SCORE_G12"),
  ScaleName = c("Physical Anxiety", "Self-Compassion", "Emotional Resilience"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Example data frame:
df <- data.frame(
  SCORE_G10 = rnorm(10),
  SCORE_G11 = rnorm(10),
  SCORE_G12 = rnorm(10),
  OtherVar  = letters[1:10],
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

# Rename the SCORE variables.
df_new <- rename_score_vars(df)
# New names will be like "score_Physical_Anxiety", "score_SelfCompassion", and "score_Emotional_Resilience"
}
