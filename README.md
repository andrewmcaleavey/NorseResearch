# NorseResearch
Facilitates research activities with Norse Feedback research data

This package contains research tools to assist people working with data generated from the Norse Feedback system. 

While I cannot include actual data here, even in anonymous form, the package should be installable through `devtools::install_github("andrewmcaleavey/NorseResearch")`. 

The appropriate data file, provided separately to authorized researchers, should be saved directly in the `data/` folder wherever the package is installed. 

See `?HF_research_data_2021` for information about the data, and other helpfiles about specific functions.
