# NorseResearch
Facilitates research activities with Norse Feedback research data. 

This package contains research tools to assist people working with data generated from the Norse Feedback system. While I cannot include actual data here, even in anonymous form, the package should still be useful in a few ways.

## Installation
The package should be installable through: 

``` r
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("andrewmcaleavey/NorseResearch")
```

## Data
The appropriate data file, provided separately to authorized researchers, should be saved directly in the `data/` folder wherever the package is installed. 

## Usage
See `?HF_research_data_2021` for information about the currently-shareable data, and other helpfiles about specific functions. 

## License

This package is licensed under the MIT license.
