#' SCORING using factor-standardized scoring system
#'
#' Ideally, this will use publically-available scoring data to score
#' standardized versions of each NF2.0 scale.
#'
#' STEPS:
#' 1. Identify optimal (graded response model) models for scoring each subscale in a way
#' that is consistent with clinical use and allows score computation with missing
#' item-level data.
#' 2. Include those models in this package
#' 3. Provide functions to compute factor scores from item-level data
#' 4. Compute factor scores from item-level data in the real and synthetic data.
